You can compile markdown files with Prepros.

Prepros also supports GitHub flavoured markdown.

If you save less files in `markdown` or `md` folder the compiled output will be saved in your `html` folder.

You can configure default `css`, `js`, and `html` folders from [project options](projects.html)
